# Gemini Discord Bot

 Discord bot that leverages the power of Google's Gemini-Pro API to interact with users in both text and image formats. It processes messages and images sent to it, generating creative and engaging responses. 

# UPDATE

This Gemini bot now is running Gemini Flash 1.5, PDF's and text files are now supported along with parsing transcripts from youtube videos and scraping of text from URLs.

The original bot that just does text and images is under `GeminiSimple.py`, If you don't want the extra capabilities and want to make something new.

## Features

- **AI-Driven Text Responses:** Gemini Bot can generate text responses to messages using Google's generative AI.
- **Image Processing:** The bot can also respond to images, combining text and visual inputs for a more engaging interaction. (Images should be under 2.5 Megs)
- **User Message History Management:** It maintains a history of user interactions via discordIDs, allowing for context-aware conversations.
- **Customizable Settings:** Users can adjust various parameters like message history length and AI response settings.

Examples:
`Write me a tweet about {url}`
`What did they think of {youtubeVideo transcript}`
